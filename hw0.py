    ## Homework 0

    This homework is different from the other assignments in this course, in that we don't actually build anything related to AI or chatbots.  Instead, this is a basic assignment meant to test two things:
    1. Getting set up with our mugrade autograding systems, and
    2. Evaluating some basic background in programming and math proficiency, of the kind you'll be expected to need for this course.

    If you can complete this assignment relatively easily, it is a good sign that your background will be sufficient for the course.  If the assignment is particularly challenging, then this might be a good indication that you would benefit from additional background before taking the course.  It's definitely not impossible to take the course while simultaneously building up this background, but it's likely going to be quite a bit harder.

    ### Basic notebook setup

    This assignment uses the [marimo notebook](https://docs.marimo.io), an alternative to the Jupyter notebook
    that was developed in 2022 in collaboration with scientists at Stanford. Like
    Jupyter, marimo is open-source, but unlike Jupyter is is a *reactive* notebook,
    keeping code and outputs in sync.

    Using marimo is optional. You can run marimo in molab, an online service similar to Google Colab, or locally. You will implement homework functions in this notebook, then test your implementations, first locally and then by submitting to the autograder.

    If you are using molab, begin by forking this notebook into your workspace by clicking the
    "Fork and Run" button at the top right of this page.

    ### Problem 1: Mugrade setup (via simple addition)

    The first problem in this homework mainly serves to introduce you to the [mugrade](https://mugrade.org) grading system.  To access the mugrade system:
    1. Visit the mugrade enrollment link shared in Ed (or shared in the email we will send to the online course participants).
    2. Sign in using the Google account associated with your _CMU Andrew email_ (for the CMU in-person course, for the online course you can use any email).

    After you have set up your mugrade account and enrolled in the class, you should see a page for the course and the available assignments.  There is also a "Show API Key" button at the top of the page.  To submit assignments, copy this key and enter it into the cell of the notebook.

    [Note: Please don't share your API key with others.  If any of you are (properly) horrified at the idea of storing an API key in the plain text of a notebook, you're welcome to add a `MUGRADE_KEY` environmental variable using any technique that will properly set the environment of the notebook.  For simplicity, and because you can't do much other than submit assignments with these keys, we're taking the simple (insecure) approach are just storing it in the notebook.]

    <summary>How mugrade works</summary>

    <p>Note: for those who want a bit more information about how mugrade works, and how it differs from other autograding systems, we'll provide a bit of info here, but understanding this is not required in anyway way for the course.  Most autograding systems work by uploading your code and running it on the grading server; this ensures that your code runs independently and functions as desired, but has the notable downside that, for complex assignments, it can be difficult to ensure that the environment of the autograder is sufficiently similar to your own environment.  Countless hours have been wasted by students trying to trace the exact way in which the autograding environment differs from their own.  This is especially a problem for machine learning assignments where GPUs are required to run the code, and we know of very few systems that handle this setup in a seamless fashion.</p>

    <p>
    This has led us to develop mugrade, which takes the different philosophy, runs
    all the autograding code _on your local system_ (or on molab), and then just
    sends the _answer_ to mugrade to check against a reference solution.  The upside
    is that we can support large courses with relatively little overhead.  The
    downside is that it does allow cheating of some type: you absolutely could
    compute the solutions manually for each mugrade test case and then submit those
    answers to get full points.  And this would almost certainly be more
    time-consuming than just solving the problem to begin with.  So in a world where
    most assignments can be solved by AI anyway, it seems a very reasonable
    trade-off to give a bit more control to students of their coding environment, at
    the cost of possibly introducing slightly more ability to game the system.  This
    is why, as a final measure, we ask for all students to upload a copy of their
    assignment, so TA's can check it as needed.

    ### Problem 2: Computing primes

    As the first "real" problem of this assignment, you'll have to write a simple routine to compute prime numbers.  You will specifically do this using a method called the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), which computes _all_ prime numbers up to some number $n$ by iteratively setting elements of an array to `False` if they cannot be a prime because they are a multiple of another number.  The [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Pseudocode) of the algorithm on the Wikipedia link above provides a pretty reasonable description of the algorithm.  As mentioned above, this particular function has nothing to do with machine learning or the rest of the course, but it is a nice demonstration of an algorithm to implement in Python, that is a good test of your general basic proficiency.

    Using this pseudocode as a reference point (but note that you _don't_ have to follow it exactly), plus the function signature below (which you _do_ need to follow exactly), implement a method for computing primes using this method.  Note that even though the algorithm computes a binary array of which numbers are prime, the function as defined below needs to return a list of just the prime numbers, so you'll need to convert to that format.

    For this function, you'll want to first run the `@mugrade.local_tests` test cases, then change this to `@mugrade.submit` once you have finished and debugged your implementation.

    ### Problem 3: Operations on polynomials

    As a last problem in this assignment, you will write code to manipulate polynomials represented by a Python class.  Again, this assignment is not directly relevant to much AI work, but it _does_ serve as a useful evaluation of your familiarity with some basic mathematical concepts, how you translate these into Python work, and in working with existing Python classes.

    The `Polynomial` class implemented below contains a basic representation of polynomials via a list of their coefficients.  Each class contains a `.coefficients` member, which is a list where `coefficients[i]` represents the coefficient on the $i$th degree term, $x^i$.  In other words, the list
    ```python
    coefficients = [1, 0, 4, 3]
    ```
    would represent the polynomial

    $$3x^3 + 4x^2 + 1,$$

    the list
    ```python
    coefficients = [4, 3, 5]
    ```
    would represent the polynomial

    $$5x^2 + 3x + 4,$$

    and so on.  Any term of degree beyond the length of the list implicitly has coefficient zero.

    The class below contains the basic implementation (which is quite sparse, other than a few helper functions and a function that returns a string representation of the polynomial).  Note that you should _not_ change any of this code in the assignment.
